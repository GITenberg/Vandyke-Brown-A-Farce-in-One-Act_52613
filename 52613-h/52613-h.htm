<p class="pad_top_half_em">M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. (<i>within</i>,
<small>R</small>. <small>D</small>.) It’s useless your denying it, Mr. Bobbins! I saw you
do it—I saw you do it with my own eyes, sir!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>within</i>, <small>R</small>. <small>D</small>.) My dear
Constantia!—before the servants!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. (<i>within</i>, <small>R</small>.
<small>D</small>.) Leave the room this instant, Rebecca! Leave the room, I say! You’ll
quit my service this day month.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>within</i>, <small>R</small>.) Certainly, ma’am! certainly!
with all my heart!</p>

<small>D</small>., <i>slapping the door behind her.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Was there ever such a temper as missus? I never see such a one—never!
If master will keep staring at me, is that my fault, I should like to know?</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> F<small>ASTMAN</small>, <i>door</i> <small>C</small>.
<i>from</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. (<small>L</small>.) Rebecca!—just one word!</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<small>R</small>.) Here’s that tiresome Mr. Fastman again.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. Well, have you anything to tell me? When is she coming home?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Lor, sir! why should you want to know? Missus has come home—she
came home this morning.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. No! you don’t say so! Where is she?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Where is she?—why, where should she be? In the next room, at
breakfast with her husband, to be sure.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. The deuce she is! Don’t talk so loud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Why not? <i>I’m</i> not ashamed of what I’m saying.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. Come home at last, then. Ah! (<i>sighs</i>) your mistress is a
beautiful woman, Rebecca.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Beautiful?—that depends upon opinion; for my part, I don’t like
tall women.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. I admire tall women. It seems to me an age since she has been
away.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. It may seem so to you, sir, but it hasn’t to me, I promise you.
I’m sure I wish she had stayed away ten times as long—for the first thing she has done on
her return has been to give me warning.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. Give you warning! What for?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Ah! what for, indeed?—you must ask her that. She is jealous of
that husband of hers. She surprised him, just now, at breakfast, making eyes at me. How
could I help it?</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. Oh, fie, Rebecca? What! do you encourage your master in that sort
of thing?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. I encourage him, indeed?—well I’m sure!—with a twelvemonth’s
character from my last place.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. I beg your pardon—well I am sorry you are going to leave—you are
such a nice obliging young woman, and I was going to ask you if you couldn’t manage to—to
give this letter.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. To my master!</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. No, not exactly that, Rebecca, to your mistress.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Indeed, sir! I shall do nothing of the sort, you had better
give it her yourself.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. But I should never have the face, I tell you. There is something
about Mrs. Bobbins that keeps me so completely at a distance, something so modest, so
correct and proper—come, now, you are not going to be illnatured, see here’s a queen’s
head for it. (<i>showing her half a crown</i>)</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Sir, I’m ashamed of you, I’ll have nothing to do with it!</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. Only give her the letter, and I’ll help you to a place.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. No, will you though? (<i>eyeing the money which he forces on
her, with the letter</i>) No! really I can’t! no, no! Well if you insist upon my taking
the money—(<i>aside—taking the money</i>) But I’ll be hanged if I give her the letter.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. Yes, I know of a place that will suit you exactly, without your
going out of the house. Mrs. Duval on the second floor here is in want of just such a
pretty, clever girl as you are, to help her in her fancy work.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Why how did you come to know her, sir?</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. How did I come to know her? why, my sisters buy their wools of
her, she embroiders my shirt fronts, marks my <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span>pocket handkerchiefs for me—you can’t be in better hands; she
is a most respectable person, and a first rate temper.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. (<i>without</i> <small>R</small>.) No,
Augustus! no, Mr. Bobbins, I say she shall not remain.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>without</i>) Nay, but Constantia!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. Silence, sir, I won’t hear a word.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. Why there’s your mistress at high words with Mr. Bobbins.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. That’s nothing new, sir.</p>

<p>F<small>AST</small>. I must beat a retreat! (<i>going</i>) But I’ll run up stairs
before I go, and speak to Mrs. Duval for you. Don’t forget the letter.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i> F<small>ASTMAN</small>, <small>C</small>. <i>to</i>
<small>R</small>.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> M<small>R</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>,
<small>R</small>., <i>in a dressing gown, followed by</i> M<small>RS</small>.
B<small>OBBINS</small>.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. Yes, Augustus! yes Mr. Bobbins, I repeat
it, she shall not remain any longer!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. But, my dear, this conduct of yours is downright oriental
despotism; of all the tyrannies, there are none like the domestic.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. She shall go this very day! It’s most
abominable! I’ll pay her wages and send her about her business!</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>coming down</i>, <small>C</small>.) Oh, very well, ma’am,
just as you please about that! I’m sure I don’t want to stay—a month’s warning, or a
month’s wages!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. Oh, you are there, are you! Bold faced
young woman, take your wages. (<i>giving her money</i>) Pack up your things and prepare to
leave my service to-night.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>counting the money</i>) Sixteen and eightpence, all right,
ma’am, and as for my place that is no great loss I’m sure! I can easily get a better! I
have only to choose. (<i>aside and tossing her head as she goes out</i>, <small>C</small>.
<i>to</i> <small>L</small>.) Straightlaced crosspatch; she’s more fit for an old maid,
than a married woman.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>in chair</i>, <small>L</small>.) Another victim to your
implacable jealousy, Constantia.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. (<small>R</small>.) Jealous of you! ha, ha,
ha! Really Augustus, you have a good opinion of yourself.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>offended, and rising</i>) Jealous of me, yes to be sure, why
not? You know you are; we can’t keep a servant in the place for it; we have been married
scarcely three years, and this is the nineteenth you have discharged.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. Well, sir, and whose fault is that? A man
without the slightest sense of common propriety! or what is due to his own dignity as a
master of a family!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Go on, my dear, go on!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. My first husband never treated me so!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Comparisons are odious, Mrs. Bobbins. That first husband of yours
was a very remarkable fellow.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. You needn’t think to pass it off so, sir:
if this is your behaviour before my face, I tremble to think what your conduct may have
been behind my back, during my absence.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Now, Constantia! my dear! Do I everlastingly torment you with
inquiries into <i>your</i> conduct during <i>my</i> absence? Here have you been scouring
the country to Salisbury alone, after a legacy, which, for anything I can discover,
appears to be all a bam, and do I annoy you on your return with ridiculous jealous fits?
On the contrary, don’t I promote and fall into all your little plans and amusements?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. Amusement! Do you think it’s any amusement
to me to be worried out of my life with lawyers, and business I don’t understand? There’s
a fresh difficulty now about a cousin abroad. If you were like other husbands, you would
never suffer a young and pretty wife, more than twenty years your junior, to travel about
alone.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Oh, my dear, I have a thorough confidence in you—there’s a
rigidity of propriety about your deportment, that will always act as an efficient
safeguard in the hour of danger.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. Don’t make too sure of that. Don’t provoke
me by your indifference to retaliate!—I should soon find an opportunity—</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Oh, oh, oh, oh!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. You should have seen the assiduous—the
delicate attentions I received in the train, all the way between the Bishopstoke station
and town, from an elegant, foreign looking gentleman—such a pair of moustachios!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Oh, oh! really now, Constantia—</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. But you know I’m the most devoted—the most
affectionate wife in the world, and have no thoughts but of you, and our dear little
boy—and so you abuse the rectitude of my principles—</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. The little cherub!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. That reminds me that you wrote me word,
that the Highgate air has quite set the darling up again, and that old nurse, Jones, was
to bring him home to-day.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Yes, Bobby is coming home to-day.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. The little pet! He is my only joy—my only
hope.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Yes, yes—a remarkably fine little chap—and extremely like his
papa! Ahem! can more be said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. By the by, how inconvenient his coming back
will be just now, that we are without a servant.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. You had better let Rebecca stay.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. Augustus! Mr. Bobbins! What again! You
exasperate me! No, sir, she shall not stay another day, if I have to run over half London
to find her substitute.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Very well, my dear. You are fond of exercise.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>OBBINS</small>. This is too much to put up with!—past all
bearing! I’ll be even with you for this, depend upon it. No, no, you needn’t think to gain
your ends, Mr. Bobbins—I’ll go round to all the tradespeople this very minute. (<i>putting
on her bonnet and shawl, which are upon table</i>, <small>R</small>.) I’ll soon put a stop
to this! I’ll soon put a stop to this!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. What a singular woman Constantia is when she once takes an idea
into her head. No human argument now would ever persuade her that I am not violently
smitten with her own maid. Ridiculous notion! ha, ha! and the best of the joke is—for
reasons of a strictly private nature, I rather encourage the idea—commit myself with
Rebecca! No, no—I look a little higher than that! The interesting object of my secret
intentions, is in no way beneath me—quite the reverse—she is above me by a flight of
stairs. It is really quite distressing, to think so charming a woman as Mrs. Duval, should
be obliged to occupy a two pair back; but then, how tastefully she sets off her room!
Clever creature! she can turn her hand to anything—Berlin wool, potichomania, crotchet,
embroidery— By the way, I begin to suspect that name of hers, Duval, is only assumed—she
doesn’t look to me at all like a Frenchwoman—and the only approach to anything in the
shape of a husband I have been able to discover, is this morning gown, which I found one
morning over a chair back in her room, and which, in a moment of pecuniary pressure, I
induced her to sell me for about four times its value. It shows the fall in my back to
some advantage, but it’s an uncommonly tight fit, although I have had it let out twice
since I bought it. I wonder how she came by it? No matter—I’m convinced I have no
rival—she is evidently pleased with my attentions, and if it hadn’t been for Mrs.
Bobbins’s ill-timed return from the country, I should—(<i>crosses to</i>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. To you—the idea! Hardly.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. And why not, Mrs. Duval? Why may I not judge of your feelings by
my own?—for as the needle is attracted by the pole—</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. (<i>interrupting him</i>) Oh, dear me! Ha,
ha, ha! really, Mr. Bobbins, you’ll be a gallant as long as you live. I am sorry to
interrupt your ecstacies, but pray can I speak a word to Mrs. Bobbins?</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. To my wife?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. Yes—I understand she has come home?</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Alas! yes.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. Alas? Why, you ought to be delighted!
(<i>sadly</i>) How fortunate Mrs. Bobbins is to be happy at home with her husband. Ah, how
I envy her.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>delighted</i>) Envy her! Mrs. Duval!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. I do, indeed, with all my heart.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>endeavouring to put his arm round her waist</i>) <i>Dear</i>
Mrs. Duval! Oh, these words—this tender confession!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. (<i>retiring,</i> <small>L</small>.) Why, Mr.
Bobbins, are you taking leave of your senses? If you wish me to remain in this room, sir,
you must restrain yourself within proper bounds.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Bounds, madam! There are no bounds to the emotions of the heart.
(<i>throwing himself on his knees</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. Oh, my dear sir, do compose yourself—I beg of
you. You are <i>too</i> poetical, you are, indeed. (<i>aside</i>) Ridiculous creature!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Tell me—only tell me—did you receive those two pots of Tom Thumb
geraniums—I know your beautiful passion for flowers.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. Yes, I thank you—but I can’t possibly think
of accepting them—in short, I must forbid all further nonsense of the kind. I give you
fair warning, that if you persist in it any longer, I shall tell Mrs. Bobbins, I shall,
indeed, and be compelled to leave my lodgings.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Oh, don’t be so cruel! Don’t say that!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. Not that I have any great affection for them
either, for if it hadn’t been for poor Br—(<i>recollecting herself</i>) for reasons only
interesting to myself, I should have given notice long ago.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. For “poor” who, madam? You excite my curiosity. I trust there is
no gentleman in the case?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. Yes, but there is, though—but I entreat you
to ask no questions. (<i>wiping her eyes</i>) Ah, Mr. Bobbins, mine is <span

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. (<i>offended</i>) You mistake my meaning,
sir, altogether. Assistance! no, sir, I am able to earn quite sufficient for my support,

I shall do as well. I am afraid, ma’am, Rebecca will never suit you.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. B<small>ROWN</small>. Pray, may I ask why?</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Oh, she’s an idle, gossipping, impertinent young hussy, and burns
no end of coals.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) That’s how you speak of me behind my back, is
it?</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. And then, ma’am, her conduct in another respect, to a lady of
your extreme propriety, I am quite sure would be highly objectionable. She encourages a

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. And as to the young lawyer, if I were the gossip he says I am,
I could tell a different story.</p>

my hat and coat?</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. There’s nobody here! Come, that’s lucky—her surprise will be the
greater. I’ve been watching at the corner of the street for the last half hour, and
contrived to slip in as the door was ajar, while the servant stepped over the way. My
heart beats like one of the drums I left behind me, at the thought of meeting my wife
again after the best part of a twelvemonth’s chequered absence in the Crimea—driven from
my native land and the cultivation of the classic style of art, by the detestable envy of
the Royal Academicians, the cupidity of the butcher, and the rapacity of the baker. A
pretty life I had of it in the <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg
11]</a></span>camp—sometimes photographic artist, sometimes—tell it not ye muses—a mixture
of cook, valet, military secretary, and volunteer. However, I should soon have made my
fortune, for I took more portraits in the Crimea in a day, than I ever did in London in a
year. When one unlucky evening, just as I was going to raise my terms, I ventured too far
on the Woronzoff Road for the purpose of making a sketch of some outworks, and all of a
sudden, when I least expected it—crack, whiz, crack! half a dozen minie balls whistled
about my ears, and a party of Russians sallied out of the flank of the Redan, and
succeeded in carrying me into the town—luckily it didn’t last long, for at the end of a
month, there was an exchange of prisoners, and I had the good fortune to be swopped for
the favourite jackass of a Russian officer that had fallen, by accident, into the hands of
the allies; so here I am, just arrived from Portsmouth, totally unknown to my wife, once
again in my own lodgings. What the deuce! fresh paper—Brussels carpet—and all this French
polished mahogany! Upon my word! why, my wife must have gone mad, or else she must be
driving a rare trade in the Berlin wool and fancy line. Stay, here she comes! I’ll get
under the table and give her a surprise. How delighted she’ll be to see me! (<i>goes
towards table,</i> <small>L</small>.) No, it’s not my wife. Why, good gracious, she keeps
an assistant, I’ll be bound.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) He is mighty familiar. Might I ask how you got
in? I didn’t hear any one knock.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. No, the door was ajar—not that it would have made any difference if
it had been shut; you see I’ve a latch key.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>shewing one.</i></p>

himself</i>) No matter for my name—I rather fancy your mistress will know me when she sees
me. I only hope it won’t be too much for her.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Oh, he must be some relation. Master said if any
one called, they were to wait.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Come, look alive—be quick.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) He’s an extraordinary looking fellow! What a
beard he has got! I hardly know what to do, as they are neither of them at home; but I
suppose there will be no harm in giving him some breakfast.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Come, I say young woman, are you going to move? You are not aware
that I haven’t tasted anything to-day.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit,</i> <small>C</small>. <i>to</i> <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. That girl wouldn’t make a bad model; but she don’t seem very
bright. Egad! I have been so long away in the Crimea, that I feel half inclined to make
love to every pretty woman I meet. That was an uncommonly fine creature that got into the
train at Bishopstoke; rather stiff though, at first, but before we came to the journey’s
end I had quite broken the ice with her. By the way, I am afraid I ran away from her
rather abruptly this morning—quite forgot to look after her luggage and all that sort of
thing. No great wonder either—once arrived in London, how could I think of any one but my
dear little wife? How I long to see her. (<i>going to sit down, sees the morning gown</i>)
What’s this? a morning gown. (<i>examining it</i>) To be sure—I recollect it. I declare,
it gave me, quite a turn! The one I had made just before I went away! Affectionate little
soul! hanging over the chair back to keep her company. I dare say she’s in the habit of
kissing and talking to it every day of her life. I feel rather tired—I’ll put it on.
(<i>takes off his coat and puts on the dressing gown</i>) Home, sweet home! they may well
say “there’s no place like home.” (<i>wrapping the gown round him</i>) Ullo! why, it fits
me like a sack. How I must have fallen away in the Crimea.</p>

she think she is going to establish herself in the house, under my wife’s nose? I must get
rid of her somehow or other. (<i>aloud, and getting impatient</i>) Madam, as I have
already said twice before, I have no time for standing on ceremony—you will therefore
excuse my coming to the point at once—anywhere else—<i>any</i>where else I shall be happy
to hear what you have to say—any place you like to appoint—St. James’s Park, Kensington
Gardens—</p>

temperament, and if you don’t take care, you’ll throw me into hysterics.</p>

like a greyhound follows a hare—tracked me to my very door? Now for goodness sake don’t

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<small>L</small>.) A present for missus.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>peeping into parcel</i>) What a beauty! all silk! What a
lovely dress it will make.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Who can possibly have given her a silk dress?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. What a question! Master, to be sure.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Master! What do you mean?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Why, sir, you know, when they have a quarrel, that’s his way of
making it up again. He always gives her a present—sometimes one thing, sometimes
another.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. (<i>dropping into a chair</i>) What—what’s that you say?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. You are not taken with a swimming in the head, are you,
sir?</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. No, no—tell me—what sort of a fellow is he—what’s his name?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Lor, sir, I thought you knew him. What, don’t you know Mr.
Bobbins?</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Bob—Bob—Bob—Bobbins! (<i>aside</i>) The name sticks in my throat as

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. I thought you were old friends, sir!</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. (<i>moving away with it</i>) Take care, sir, what do you want
with it? (<i>putting it on table behind her</i>)</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Bobbins! eh! Bobbins! Do you hear, young woman! Tell me, at what

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Come here? Who do you mean, sir?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Won’t you take your breakfast, sir? it’s all getting cold.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Don’t talk to me of breakfast! Stay! on second thoughts I don’t

into training like a prize fighter! eat raw beefsteaks every day for a month, and then

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Yes, sir, there it is on the table. Were you expecting any one

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. No, no one—(<i>looking up</i>) why, has anybody been?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Yes, sir!</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. What name?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. He wouldn’t give any name, sir. He came in with a latch key,

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. With a latch key? How do you mean? How did he come by it?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. I don’t know, sir; he appears to be a very extraordinary

get him some breakfast.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Some begging imposter, I dare say.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. No, sir, I don’t think that, he was very well dressed.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. That’s nothing, he might have been one of the swell mob for
anything you know to the contrary—the town swarms with well dressed swindlers
now-a-days.</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. He said he wanted to see mistress.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Well, and how did you get rid of him?</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. I didn’t get rid of him at all, sir; he is in the house
now.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Nonsense!</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. I thought he was some relation or friend of the family—he’s
taking his breakfast in the parlour.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Taking his breakfast in the parlour! What? alone with the silver
spoons!</p>

<p>R<small>EBECCA</small>. Good gracious, I never thought of that!</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. (<i>without,</i> <small>L</small>. <small>D</small>.) I say, what’s

you permit me to ask you one question? I throw myself entirely upon your generosity. Did
you—frankly—did you expect to find me here?</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. No, sir, frankly, I did not—certainly not.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Sir, I thank you; you have removed a weight from my mind. I could
scarcely believe otherwise, only just arrived, as I am, from abroad.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Only just arrived from abroad—oh, indeed, sir. (<i>aside</i>)
Confound the fellow, I wish I could get rid of him. (<i>aloud, after a pause of confusion

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Oh certainly, sir—certainly. Russia, sir, Russia.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>aside</i>) All a lie, I suppose. (<i>aloud</i>) Indeed, sir.
(<i>after another pause</i>) Pray, sir, what may be your opinion of the Russians in

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Very nice people, sir—very nice people.</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Indeed, sir.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. (<i>rising, after a long pause, during which they have been staring
at each other, not knowing what to say</i>) Sir, I am very happy to have met you. Your
conversation betokens great intelligence, and I regret extremely that I have not more time
to improve the acquaintance, but unfortunately an unlucky engagement—</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>taking him up</i>) Pray don’t mention it, sir—pray don’t
mention it. (<i>aside</i>) Thank goodness he is going at last. (<i>each puts his chair
back, and, fancying the other gone, they meet in the centre, and stare at each other</i>)
Well, sir?</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. Well, sir, you have the advantage of me. To whom have I the honour
of speaking?</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. Before I answer that question, I must know what right you have to
ask it.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. This is mere evasion, sir. I must request the favour of your name.
I have no wish to be personal, but, really, there are so many vagabonds going about
now—</p>

<p>A<small>UGUS</small>. (<i>taking him up</i>) Exactly, that’s just it; what you say is
so perfectly true, that I don’t feel safe with you, although I am in my own lodgings.</p>

<p>V<small>AN</small>. What do you mean by presuming to call these lodgings yours.
(<i>aside</i>) A horrible suspicion! (<i>aloud</i>) Who are you, sir? I insist upon

Terror, or the Rump Parliament—they’re nothing to it.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
